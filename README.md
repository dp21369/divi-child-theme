# Why You Need a Divi Child Theme
Divi is a WordPress theme. Whenever you need to make modifications to any WordPress theme, it is best practice to create a child theme that inherits the design and functionality of that parent theme. One important reason to create a child theme is to preserve the modifications you make when updating the parent theme. Whenever you update Divi, all of the theme files are updated so if you have made any changes to these files, those changes will be erased. So, instead of modifying Diviâ€™s theme files directly, you can create additional theme files within a child theme so that when Divi is updated, those child theme files remain unchanged. Therefore, if you plan on making advanced customizations to your theme like modifying page templates and/or adding large amounts of CSS/JavaScript, and/or adding new functions, it is best to make these changes to your child theme without ever having to touch the parent theme files.
